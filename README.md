# 🌤️ Flutter Weather Forecast UI

This is a beginner Flutter project I created to **learn and practice Flutter UI development**.  
The goal of this project is not to build a fully working weather app (yet), but to explore:

- How **widgets** are placed and structured
- Using **StatefulWidget** and **StatelessWidget**
- Styling with **gradients**, **Google Fonts**, and **custom layouts**
- Displaying **images, icons, and text**
